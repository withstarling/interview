# AI Phone Screen Interview Project

## Overview

This is a starter template for building an AI-powered phone screening system. The goal is to automate first-round phone screens with candidates, allowing recruiters to initiate calls and review structured call logs through an operator console.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

2. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application

## Project Requirements

### MVP Features to Implement

1. **Outbound Voice Call**
   - Create a way to initiate calls using Vapi

2. **Scripted Dialogue**
   - Implement an AI agent that asks screening questions:
     - Role interest
     - Years of experience
     - Tech stack familiarity
     - Work authorization status

3. **Transcription Storage**
   - Store call transcripts in a database - focus on getting something working quickly first 
   - Design appropriate data models

4. **Operator Console**
   - Start Call form with phone number input
   - Call logs table view
   - Call detail view with full transcript

5. **API Design**
   - Define and implement necessary API endpoints for:
     - Starting calls
     - Fetching call logs
     - Retrieving call details/transcripts
